Analysis
Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.
In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals’ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.
The present report includes various tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study as well as a top-level summary of the study results.

The analysis included 10 Drug Regimens and 248 mices: 
•	Capomulin
•	Ramicane 
•	Ketapril  
•	Naftisol    
•	Zoniferol    
•	Placebo      
•	Stelasyn     
•	Infubinol    
•	Ceftamin     
•	Propriva

We have produced few statistical figures with Tumor Volume size that are included in this report.
Analysis summary will focus on Capomulin and Ramicane and Infubinol and Ceftamin.
Below chart compares the Tomor Volume size through the time period of the study and shows the efficiency of Capomulin and Ramicane leading to the best effect on the tumor. The red point seems to be a potential outlier for  Infubinol.
 
This is confirmed when looking at Mice l509 as shown in below chart. The Tumor volume kept increasing after 18 days of treatments and then dropped significantly until 23rd day. At the end of the study the tumor size has decreased from 45.85 to 40.20.
 
The last charts focus on the correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume showing a clear correlation.
